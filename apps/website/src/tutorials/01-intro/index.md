# Introduction

Greetings, traveler! You have stumbled upon the tutorial of a sveltest game engine in the realm,
namely Roguelighter. This tutorial will teach you everything you need to know to make a simple game
with this engine. For the time being, you can only publish these games on the Web or Windows.

If you are an impatient fellow and want to get on with tinkering, you can [download the latest version]

# What is Roguelighter?

Roguelighter is a low code game engine you can use to make simple games for desktop and the web

It uses a single configuration file that is powered by TypeScript to construct your entire game.

Youâ€™ll need to have basic familiarity with TypeScript to understand Roguelighter.

Roguelighter's configuration file is made up of seven smaller parts:
Settings
Agents
GUI
.
.
.
.

In each chapter we will take a closer look to these smaller parts and see how they contribute
to the system.

By default, the config file will be prepopulated for you, so you don't have to copy-paste a template
file each time you create a new project.

In the settings chapter, we will see how the parameters in settings affect the game world.
